      I am an aspiring software engineer.

    For the past five years, I have worked as an Assistant Editor at Alfred A. Knopf, under Jordan Pavlin, Senior Vice President and Editorial Director; and Erroll McDonald, Vice President and Executive Editor. 
    In addition to shepherding books from initial contract through publication—as a point of contact for authors and in collaboration with literary agents, designers, legal consultants, publicists, and production staff to ensure that deadlines are met and the author’s vision is supported—I have contributed editorial work on four books published or soon to be published by Knopf: 
    Kent Russell’s kaleidoscopic book of narrative nonfiction, <em>In the Land of Good Living, </em> Fernando Aramburu’s novel about the Basque civil war, <em> Homeland, </em>, Giulio Boccaletti's <em> Water: A Biography </em> and Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s encyclopedic work on overlooked African American history, <em> 100 Amazing Facts About the Negro </em>. 
    I have deeply valued my time at Knopf and have gained valuable experience in all aspects of publishing.
